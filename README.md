# How Fred Grott and GWS Work

I strongly believe in a well planned and executed project that results in a working
android java application that the end user falls-in-love with. It starts with me completing a project
interview with you to make sure that you are aware of the budget ranges for a highly interactive android
java application, usually between $60, 000 and $96,000. Once I confirm the budget range than its a project
set of spec interviews to verify that what you want in form of the android java application will help
your firm reach both your short-term and long-term goals:

return-on-investment, will your firm receive the benefits that out-weigh the investment costs

project scope matches project budget

time to develop the application matches project scope and budget

than it is matter of writing up a contract that has weekly milestones with payment being made after the milestone has been reached and only a week advance.

The way I handle late payments is that project work stops and project work does not
being again until my project queue has an opening. This way you do not get punished by a late interest
fee but instead your behavior gets enhanced to align with both our goals.

# Demos

## Applications

I am referring to highly-interactive android java applications. Some of these demos show work-flow attributes
as most enterprise android java applications have some complex workflow components.


## UI Controls

Part of the branding part of the UI is to create a sticky activity that integrates with a mobile activity
and at the same time visually reminds the android device user that it is your company that provided the
android application. I accomplish that through customizing UI controls, for example these controls:

# About Fred Grott and GrottWorkShop

![GWS Logo](/art/gws_logo_longform_final.png)


I call it GrottWorkShop because it takes value and art to create heroes in both
Start-Ups and Mobile Application end Users. It is a craft act in that each mobile
application is like no other mobile application. Every firm or Start-Up is unique, should not your mobile android application reflect the values and unique personality of your firm? I think it should.

I choose to make both start-ups and mobile application end-users heroes by getting
start-ups to accept change in their mobile android application work-flows and UIs
to get to that sweet-spot of hockey-stick-like downloads and MAUs growth. I pioneer
new agile approaches to get that sweet-spot of an application code infrastructure
that allows me to fast prototype new application work-flows and new UIs.
